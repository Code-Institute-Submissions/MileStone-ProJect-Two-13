[Live Milestone Project 2](https://romanstr-code.github.io/MileStone-ProJect-Two/)

<h2 align="center">Code Institute / Interactive Frontend Development. Second Milestone Project</h2>

<h2 align="center">Coffee Houses Reviews</h2>

Code Institute gives you a variety of ideas from where to pick and start your projects. In the Second Milestone Project I went with an idea what I have in mind 
for some time and that is: Coffee Houses Reviews. Because I am a coffe lover and always want to try new coffee shops and the techniques that changes from place to place.
So I would truly like if there would be a website that would be owned by profesionals baristas who just walk arround the city or arround the country
looking for amazing hidden places that deffinetly would worth visiting by people like me.
From this simple idea I started to build the site. At first, for first page, was thinking of simple first page, a background image on all screen. Want to keep the buttons on minimal and to point
just on the pages which the user need  to pay attention the most. The main text, it ment to be on the middle of the page and describe short what the website is about
plus a button to call for user attention to click. <br>

<strong>Reviews</strong> <br>
On the first page on accessing the website, I was thinking it would be informative to have displayed three Coffee shops, that Baristas already reviewed and encourage to visit.
As well, the page should display the places that was spoke off when enter the page. For doing that I opted for a modal-gallery, and to make it as Interactive as possible for user buy adding some <em>JS</em> for modal gallery that visitors can click or 
on tablets and mobile buy touch to pop and see the image and where was done. Also, would be great if site visitors could access the gallery stright, so I added a button with <em>JS</em> help to take them to gallery and back to top for reading the Reviews.
On all website I decided to go with a simple footer, to display just copyright and button back to top. 
To take the transition slowly and directly to next page added buttons to each review, to point to their locations if visitors would find them interesting and would like to visit them.
<br>

<strong>Locations</strong><br>
Arriving on Locations page. I wanted for user to feel Welcomed and find the piece of information quick and as simple as possible. For doing that, I opted for a simple page with information just related to the reviews page from where user will travel.
So You will find a division with a background image, should display something related or to point to a map or direction. On top of that short text to display a direct message to traveler and a modal body with some curiosity about the people who deal with cofee deeply.
Then went with a division with a map and those three shops that the review is about. The map I decided to do just with three markers and to point in three directions, where the places are. Above the map, should be displayed addresses for all 3 shops.
A obvious choice from here on is to go check who are the people behind this reviews. In an clear step, you find easy, on the navigation bar <em>Team</em>, so you access it to check them out.<br>

<strong>Team</strong><br>
The idea of this page is, to emphasize the  profesionality and level of knowledge of the website owners and love for double shots of espressos.
So decided to go with couple of divisions to include all above in a nice and slow pace.
So first division is about the Team, small text of what they do and their image displayed. Going to next division you can find thier love and affection for what they do and from where and how a proper cup of coffee it's done.
And for better and more information went with buttons to redirect to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) for more detailed information.
Traveling down the page you can find a quote division, with a nice quote on top of a nice background image.
Scrolling further down the page you encounter the last division. Now this division should make an impact on the future colaborations with other coffee lovers, coffee shop owners and point to contact this amazing team.
So your eye slightly see the image of a coffee cup and short team text with a button that call you to contact the team.
As well in this division they inform and alert about their activity and trainings that they provide. Added a small pices of <em>JS</em> alert to point to trinings and separated them in three cards.
Each card should have buttons to point again for more information and to take website traveler to it. Now, for thouse who decided they need to make contact with the team easy can navigate on the navigation bar to section Contact or by clicking on the last division button contact us.<br>

<strong>Contact</strong><br>
On Contact Us page, the idea behind was simple, but with a small touch. My Thoughts about contact page was to have a division with a background image and a plain white text that would say : CONTACT US.
By Scrolling down you first would encounter a division that should ask to get in touch with team and be separated by 3 columns and on each column to be separated by 3 vertical lines and on mobile to form one.
Each column to represent different ways to be contacted and reached. And also added the contact form in this division for potential colaborations and Interactivity with the website travelers.
Under the Contact Us form , included a section with couple of social links to be displayed for the users to follow the team on them.
Then I liked the idea of adding a google map with a custom button that point out to new coffee places to check. By clicking the button on the map should be displayed couple of markers and appear on the map in a consecutive order, not all at once.<br>

Wanted to mention that on this project I decided to go with a minimalistic footer and minimal content on all pages footer.
In conclusion, the site is build for a group of coffee lovers, or coffee house owners with big experience that they have in industry and wich they want to share with people and to entertain them with fantastic places to visit.
The site is easy to navigate, from first page when accessing you can clearly understand the steps you should take for easy site travel. 
Each page is displayed on the navigation bar and is easy to access and is intuitive for all kind of travelers. If you are here to find new places you can easy find them if you are here to 
ask for colaboration with the team is as well easy to access their service.
Each page is different and uniq in their own ways and all of them indicate into very exact and specific direction for all users to find it easy to understand.
